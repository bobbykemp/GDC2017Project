## To Update Forked Repository (IMPORTANT!)

Since this repository only tracks files (No .meta files), you must manually copy and paste files from repository to your Unity Project folder.

To ensure all assets are updated, **Remove all files from your <Unity Project Folder>/Assets, then paste the Assets folder from repository to Unity Porject folder**.
